## Instruction to Run
1. **Create and seed database**: clone or download the repo, optionally change the database name and server at StocksChat/StocksChat.Web/appsettings.json. Then run a command prompt at StocksChat/StocksChat.Web and run ```dotnet ef database update --project ..\StocksChat.Persistence\StocksChat.Persistence.csproj```
2. **Run web project**: If you opened the solution is Visual Studio, simply set as Startup project the StocksChat.Web project and hit run. Otherwise, browse to StocksChat/StocksChat.Web in the command prompt and type ```dotnet run```, open a web browser to the specified location.
3. **Login**: You will immediately be asked to log in. To log in as the first user, use user1@stockschat.com as username and P@ssw0rd! as password. To log in as the second user, use user2@stockschat.com and the same password.
4. **Run the Bot**: In the same way as step 2, run the StocksChat.Bot application. Don't close the command window (leave the application running).
5. **Chat**: Chat between users or with the bot. To invoke the bot simply type /stock=aapl.us or any other stock ticker. After a few seconds the bot will respond with the Open price for that stock for the current day. Messages generated by the bot are not saved to the database.
